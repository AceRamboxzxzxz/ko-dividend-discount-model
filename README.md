# Coca-Cola (KO) Dividend Discount Model

## Overview
This project values Coca-Cola (KO) using the Gordon Growth Dividend Discount Model (DDM) built entirely in Excel.

The model estimates the intrinsic value of KO stock based on expected future dividends, assuming constant long-run dividend growth.

## Methodology
- Historical quarterly dividends aggregated into annual dividends
- Dividend growth estimated using historical averages
- Required return estimated using CAPM
- Intrinsic value calculated using the Gordon Growth Model

## Key Assumptions
- Latest completed annual dividend (D₀): $1.64
- Long-run dividend growth rate (g): 4.0%
- Required return (r): 7.0%

## Results
- Estimated intrinsic value: ~$56.85 per share
- Current market price (at time of analysis): ~$71.44
- Under conservative dividend-based assumptions, KO appears overvalued relative to intrinsic value

## Limitations
- Assumes constant perpetual dividend growth
- Highly sensitive to growth and discount rate assumptions
- Best suited for mature, dividend-paying companies

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Yahoo Finance (dividend data)
